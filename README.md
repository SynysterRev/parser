# Parser
 
Python 3.12.3

Project completed as part of the HarvardX CS50AI course.

This program parses sentences to analyze their structure and extract noun phrases (NPs). Parsing is a key task in natural language processing (NLP), helping computers understand sentence meaning and extract relevant information.

Using predefined grammar rules, the program identifies noun phrases, which are often useful for summarization, information retrieval, and text analysis.
